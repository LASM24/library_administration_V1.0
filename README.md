Library Administration V1.0
Welcome to Library Administration V1.0!


Overview
This project is a simulation of a library management system, developed entirely in Python (using only the typing module). It allows users to interact with the system via the console. Users can perform various tasks such as adding books, lending books, returning books, and viewing the list of available books. Please note that this functionality is only available during runtime, as the book records are stored in an array.

Features
Add Books: Add new books to the library collection.
Lend Books: Borrow books from the library.
Return Books: Return borrowed books to the library.
View Available Books: Display a list of books currently available in the library.
Project Details
This project is designed to be simple and practical, serving as a foundation for more advanced features in future versions. While functional, it currently lacks certain features such as validation for returning books, the ability to store multiple copies of a book, and the implementation of more sophisticated methods. However, these shortcomings will be addressed in upcoming versions of the project.

Future Updates
I plan to continue updating this project, as it serves as the basis for a larger full-stack web application. In future versions, I intend to integrate databases, web services, and a user-friendly interface to enhance the user experience and showcase my skills in full-stack development.

How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the Python script.
Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the library management system.
